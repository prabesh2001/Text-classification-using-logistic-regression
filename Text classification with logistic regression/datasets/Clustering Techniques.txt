  Title:   Clustering Techniques in Machine Learning  
  Content:    
Clustering is an unsupervised learning method used to group data points that share similar features. Unlike classification, clustering does not require labeled data, making it useful for exploratory data analysis.  
Popular clustering algorithms include k-means, which partitions data into k clusters, and DBSCAN, which can identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. Clustering has applications in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression, helping discover hidden patterns in large datasets.
