  Title:   Understanding Bias-Variance Tradeoff  
  Content:    
The bias-variance tradeoff is a key concept in machine learning that reflects the balance between underfitting and overfitting. A model with high bias tends to underfit the data, missing important patterns, while a model with high variance overfits the data, capturing noise as if it were meaningful.  
The goal is to find a balance where the model generalizes well to new data. Regularization techniques, cross-validation, and careful selection of model complexity can help manage this tradeoff effectively.
