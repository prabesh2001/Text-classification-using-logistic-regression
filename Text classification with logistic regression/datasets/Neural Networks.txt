  Title:   Convolutional Neural Networks Explained  
  Content:    
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models particularly effective for image data. CNNs use layers of convolutional filters to automatically detect features such as edges, textures, and shapes in images. These features are combined in deeper layers to recognize more complex structures, such as objects or faces.  
Unlike traditional models, CNNs require minimal manual feature extraction, making them highly efficient for computer vision tasks. Applications include facial recognition, medical image analysis, and even art generation.
