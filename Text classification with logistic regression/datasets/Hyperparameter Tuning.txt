  Title:   Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning  
  Content:    
Hyperparameters are parameters of machine learning algorithms that are set before the learning process begins. Unlike model parameters, hyperparameters are not learned during training and need to be tuned for optimal performance.  
Techniques like grid search and random search are commonly used to find the best hyperparameters. Advanced methods like Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms can also be employed to automate the search for optimal hyperparameter settings, improving model accuracy and efficiency.
