  Title:   Key Concepts in Natural Language Processing  
  Content:    
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to process, understand, and generate human language. Tasks in NLP include language translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Tokenization is the first step, breaking down text into words or sentences.  
Part-of-speech tagging assigns labels like nouns or verbs to tokens, while parsing helps understand sentence structure. With the advent of deep learning, models like transformers (e.g., BERT and GPT) have revolutionized NLP, achieving state-of-the-art performance in understanding and generating human language.
