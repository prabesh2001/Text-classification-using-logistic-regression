  Title:   Dimensionality Reduction Techniques  
  Content:    
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables in a dataset while retaining essential information. This is useful for visualization, speeding up algorithms, and avoiding the curse of dimensionality.  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most common techniques, reducing dimensions by projecting data onto new axes that capture the most variance. Another technique, t-SNE, is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data by mapping it into a lower-dimensional space.
