  Title:   Predictive Modeling in Data Science  
  Content:    
Predictive modeling involves using machine learning or statistical techniques to forecast future events based on historical data. The process includes selecting a model, training it on existing data, and using it to predict outcomes on new, unseen data.  
Predictive models are widely used in finance for credit scoring, in healthcare for disease prediction, and in marketing for customer churn analysis. Key challenges in predictive modeling include overfitting, data imbalance, and the need for accurate feature selection.
