  Title:Introduction to Support Vector Machines  
  Content:    
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful supervised learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes of data.  
In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVMs use kernel functions to project the data into a higher-dimensional space. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and are widely used in text classification, image recognition, and bioinformatics.
