  Title:   Data Preprocessing Techniques for Machine Learning  
  Content:    
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning pipeline, ensuring that raw data is transformed into a clean and usable format. Techniques include handling missing data, normalization, standardization, and feature scaling.  
Data often contains noise, errors, or irrelevant information, which can negatively affect the performance of machine learning models. Cleaning the data, converting categorical variables to numerical values, and splitting the data into training and test sets are some of the common steps involved in preprocessing.
