  Title:   The Role of Data in AI  
  Content:    
Data is the foundation of any AI system. AI models, particularly machine learning models, rely on vast amounts of data to learn and make accurate predictions. In supervised learning, data needs to be labeled, while unsupervised learning works with raw, unlabeled data.  
The quality and quantity of data directly affect the performance of AI systems. Data preprocessing, such as cleaning and feature extraction, ensures that the data fed into models is relevant and informative. As data continues to grow exponentially, handling and managing this data effectively remains a major challenge in AI development.
