# Text Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a **Text Classification** model using **Logistic Regression**, focused on classifying documents related to **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. The model uses a **Bag of Words** approach to convert text data into numerical features and applies logistic regression to perform classification. 

## Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 20 text-based documents covering topics such as **AI** and **Data Analytics**. Each document follows a simple format where a **Title** is followed by a **Content** section. These documents are used to train and test the model.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Flask application for user input and querying the dataset.
- **`classify.py`**: Python script for running the text classification model using logistic regression.
- **`datasets/`**: Folder containing text documents for training and testing.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the Flask web interface.
- **`static/`**: CSS files for the web interface.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries.
- **`README.txt`**: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-classification-logistic-regression.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure your dataset is placed in the `datasets/` directory.

## Running the Project

### 1. Flask Application:
To run the web interface, execute:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server. You can access the interface in your browser and enter queries to classify documents based on relevance.

### 2. Command-Line Usage:
You can run the classification model directly through the command line by running:

```
python classify.py
```

This will train and evaluate the logistic regression model using the provided dataset and display the results.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Seaborn (optional, for plotting)
- Matplotlib (optional, for plotting)

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: How well the model predicts the correct classes.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: To measure the performance of classification on imbalanced data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: For visualizing model performance on a document-level classification task.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset.
2. Train the Logistic Regression model using the `classify.py` script.
3. Query documents via the Flask interface or directly from the command line.
